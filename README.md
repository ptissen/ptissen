### Hi there 👋

I'm just a regular guy who likes programming and embedded systems :)

If you want to contact me, just send me an email. Since I don't want to receive too many bot messages, just compose my email from my username, the @ sign and the email provider (username: ptissen, email provider: outlook.de). Hopefully not every bot manages this :)

Feel free to check my Gitlab Account too: [tissen](https://gitlab.com/Tissen)
